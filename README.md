# KoreanForEnglishSpeakers

This app was my project I created while teaching myself Android Studio. It's a flashcard program that you can use to learn a language, here it's Korean. You can set how many words you want to learn per day. It will then reintroduce words for you to review based on its difficulty. Which is determined based on how often you have correctly remembered each particular word. I created the audio through Google's Cloud speech synthesis program and its included as an asset. 

Of course being the project that I learned Android Studio with this ended up growing a little out of control. If I were to create this again from scratch it would definitely be formatted better. Things like accessing the room database on the main thread, having one main activity that simply changes layouts, buttons that should be textviews, etc. It functions fine but definitely would benefit from being refactored.
